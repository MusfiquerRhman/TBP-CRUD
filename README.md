## Tech Stack
 - React
 - TypeScript
 - TailwindCSS

## approach 
 - Mobile First: I have used the "Mobile First" approach for responsive design, as Tailwind is designed based on this principle.
 - DRY: I have also followed the Don't Repeat Yourself principle and all the reusable parts are their own components
    - All the buttons, inputs and forms have variants implemented so they can be used throughout the project
 - Modeler: All the components are in their molecular form for better performance
 - Optimized: useCallback, React.memo and other methods of preventing unnecessary rerenders were implemented
 - Lazy: Products are loaded lazily using React.lazy and Suspense to optimize performance
 - Every Input has validation and type checking, try inputting incorrect / invalid values
